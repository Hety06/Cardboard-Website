  <div class="title"><h1>The Wonderful Wonders of Cardboard</h1></div>

  <div class="desc"><p>Where to start, carboard is an amazing resource that is often taken for granted by the modern day society. It is light yet has a suprisingly durable framework, it is extremely useful yet easy to make. Cardboard has done so much for the modern day human. Did you know that almost every household has at least one cardboard box in it, and that's a fact (sort of).</p></div>

  <div class="brag"><p>Making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL2yvqSk8Ww">cardboard</a> is not very hard but the process is still quite impressive. I'm sure you've seen the pattern inside of carboard that is reminiscent of honeycombing</p></div>

  <div class="desc2"><p>Cardboard is surprisingly the main ingredient for the illustirous Google Cardboard. The Google Cardboard is an amazing device that introduced VR to the wide public, for the very low price of $15!</p></div>
